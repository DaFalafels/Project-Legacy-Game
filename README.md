# Project Legacy Game

Project Legacy is a game made in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy console. The code is all LUA, and it was written by myself. The sprites were all done by myself in PICO-8's own sprite creator/editor with design ideas and help from a friend of mine, Nick. Nick also wrote the official narrative, characters, world, and setting the game takes place in. 

This was my first attempt at making a video game in PICO-8, and it was also my first time coding in LUA. It was very easy to code in, but nonetheless, it was a lot of fun as I learned more on how to think like a game developer. I have other games I have worked on before, but this was the most fun I have had working on one. This project took about 5 weeks to work on. From March 2024 - April 2024. 

In regards to the LUA code itself, unfortunately, I have lost the code as I failed to back the code up when I had to format my PC earlier this year after I was done working on the game dur to an unrelated manner. I was lucky to have the compiled game executable file that can be played. The game is far from being complete as it was a game project to showcase in a local discord game jam I was apart of, but it was made with passion. I am proud of the work Nick and I was able to accomplish with this project. Please, feel free to try it out if you want. Thanks.
